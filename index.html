                        <p>Nagoya Castle was constructed on the orders of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA. Construction was completed in 1612. In May 1945, during the air raids on Nagoya in the Second World War, the original Nagoya Castle, surmounted by its resplendent golden dolphins, was burned down. In 1959, the main donjon, the small donjon, the abutment bridge between the two, and the main gate were reconstructed.</p>

                        <p>Atsuta Jingu was originally founded about 1900 years ago, when the sacred sword Kusanagi-no-tsurugi, one of the Imperial symbols, was enshrined. The shrine buildings were maintained by the effort of devout generals of successive times, such as the Shoguns of Muromachi and Edo Shogunates, Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and the Tokugawas, ruling family of Owari district. Ever since Atsuta Jingu has been specially revered by people, ranking second only to the Great Shrine of Ise.</p>
